anInitialSuite.e2e.ts is a special case.  We want to validate that the Salesforce extensions and
most SFDX commands are not present at start up.

We also want to verify that after a project has been created, that the Salesforce extensions are loaded,
and that the SFDX commands are present.

Because of this requirement, this suite needs to run first before the other suites.  Since the
suites run in alphabetical order, this suite has been named so it runs first.
